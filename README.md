CarteDeParis
============

Offline map of Paris with GPS position built on Cordova for iOS. The tiles (200Mo) come from OpenStreetMap.org and are displayed by LeafletJS.

Sometimes internet is slow on Paris or in the MÃ©tro so I made this app to have quick access to a map. This map was on the App Store in 2012 for free but is no longer in it (expensive).

Usage
=========

- Open the project on Cordova
- Build and play
